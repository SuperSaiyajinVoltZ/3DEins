# 3DEins Card Generator

With this you can generate your own Card Spritesheet for 3DEins.

Just edit the png graphics from `gfx/cards/` and then run "make" to compile the Spritesheet.

Better keep the Transparency for the Cards, otherwise you wouldn't be able to customize card colors.

**You need devkitARM & Tex3ds to compile this!**
