# 3DEins Card Generator

With this you can generate your own Card Spritesheet for 3DEins.

Just edit the png graphics from `gfx/cards/` and then run "make" to compile the Spritesheet.

You can find a full spritesheet to the cards inside "templates" if you like to modify it directly. The cards must be 60x90!!

The Card deck is from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)#/media/File:UNO_cards_deck.svg).

Better keep the Transparency for the Cards, otherwise you wouldn't be able to customize card colors.

**You need devkitARM & Tex3ds to compile this!**
